# nvm

A wrapper for node that allows for use without admin and will utilise the nvmrc file.

nvm commands:

* all - Lists all versions from the last 5 years in order
* all-verbose - List all versions
* install - installs a version
* use - sets a version as default - can be used with install
* uninstall - removes a version

Currently windows only.  Because I don't want to deal with cross platform

npm, npx  and node projects basically mirror their counter parts
